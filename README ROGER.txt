Hi Roger!

So, for my purposes right now (as I've briefly explained in the paper) I am working with TEI Boilerplate in order to make
my code display in a way that I can edit without too much trouble. In order to get it to work, I had to put my file within
the TEI Boilerplate folder system, so you can find it here on this repository at:

TEI-Boilerplate-master/dist/content/House of Mirth.xml

Two other files within TEI Boilerplate that I have edited may also be of interest:

TEI-Boilerplate-master/dist/content/teibp.xsl
and 
TEI-Boilerplate-master/dist/CSS/teibp.css

Thank you for all of your help this semester! 
I hope we can chat soon.

Richard
